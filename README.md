# A first attempt at a basic training tool

In this project I am using fast-api to log bodyweight.
The goal for this project is to learn proper use of:

    Python
    API 
    Postgres SQL
    Docker
    CI/ID

# How to run test:
```bash
test versjon IN MEMORY
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Enter http://localhost:8000/docs in webbrowser to see API running
